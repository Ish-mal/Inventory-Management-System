This C++ application is a basic inventory and sales management system. This is a synopsis of its structure and functionality:

1. Product Class: Depicts a product together with its name, ID, quantity, and cost. It provides ways to extract specific properties and show product details.

2. Inventory Class: Oversees an assortment of goods. It enables the inventory to be expanded and shows every item that is presently in stock.

3. Customer Class: Contains the name and address of a customer. It has a way to show client information.

4. Order Class: A customer's order is represented by this class. It includes a list of the products that were ordered as well as the customer's details. Order information can be displayed and orders can be recorded.

5. Main Function: The program's entrance point is the main function. Users can interact with the system using a menu-driven interface that offers choices to add products, show products, log orders, and display orders. It employs exception handling to gently manage mistakes.

Data Structures: Arrays are used by the application to store customer orders and inventory items.
